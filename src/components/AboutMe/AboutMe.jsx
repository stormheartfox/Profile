              I am a Software Engineer located in Central Coast, NSW. I
              currently work for Australia Post; one of Australia's most
              recognizable brands, delivering the majority of the countries
              parcels. I work as a Data-Analyst keeping key stakeholders of the
              business informed about the day to day operations of the business.

              As an Indigenous Australian from Bundjalung Country, my passion
              for projects lies in creating accessibility and empowerment for
              other Indigenous Australians throughout the nation to succeed in
              the tech industry.
